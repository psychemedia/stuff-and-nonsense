## Corpse Candle

In Bygones, [February, 1872, p. 36](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2092952/7#?xywh=-478%2C-702%2C5026%2C3315):

I never heard of 'Grwn' death token mentioned by *edromo*, but I remember, some years ago, a highly intelligent inhabitant of Criggion, Montgomeryshire, telling me that when he was a bot, upon one occasion, during a vey heavy snow, his mother called him to her as she went up the stars one night to bed, and pointed out to him a light proceeding slowly from a neighbouring farmhouse in the direction of the church. A servant coming up the stairs at the time was also witness to it. The light traversed a line where there was no road or gate into the churchyard, and in a moment or two all the windows of the church were lighted up, and then gradually the light went back by the course it had come, and vanished in the neighbouring farmhouse. They knew, I believe, that their neighbour the farmer was unwell, but the snow was so deep that it was not until the second day that they heard he had died at the very time they saw the light. The snow continued, and the roads became more and more blocked, so that on the day of the funeral it was found to be impossible to take the procession by the ordinary course; so a portion of the churchyard wall was taken down, and the bier was carried through the opening. That portion was the very spot at which my friend saw the light cross on the evening of the death. –Jarco.

## First Corpse In a Cemetery

In ["A LADY TOURIST—ANECDOTES"](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000446/18380228/034/0003), Inverness Courier, Wednesday 28 February 1838, extracted from *"Hill and Valley, or Hours in England and Walks. By Catharine Sinclair, &c.. Dedicated the Travellers Club."*

The Highlanders have a superstition, which I never could trace to its origin, that Satan gets possession of the first corpse laid in new cemetery ! The time when I heard of this was in 1830 at Blair; on which occasion the innkeeper happened to mention, that a new burying-ground had been prepared during some years without ever coming into use, on account of no neighbouring family liking to lake the precedence. 'We are just waiting,' added the worthy landlady, looking hard at *me*, 'to see if, by good chance, some stranger dies in the place, who could be laid there at once.' After that, I very nearly resolved to sleep without a pillow at Blair, in case of being Burked ; and it is remarkable that an English sportsman about that time *fairly* died there, when, alter his interment in the new cemetery, it was adopted into use."

# A Mysterious Turnip

Bye-gones, April 12, 1876, p41-2

A MYSTERIOUS TURNIP.—The Monmouthshire Merlin, somewhere about the year 1832, narrated a wonderful story of a turnip. At the time the paragraph appeared, a man had plucked a turnip in crossing a field, which, to his astonishment resembled in shape a man's right hand, minus the thumb. This he exhibited in Monmouth, and it was said that half a dozen years before, the body of a man named Gurney, a toll-gate keeper, had been found barbarously murdered in a turnip field near Ledbury. The unfortunate man, in his agonies, had grasped his hands full of the green tops of the turnips. A waggoner, named Powell, an athletic man, and who had by accident lost his right thumb, was apprehended on suspicion of being concerned in the murder, but for lask of evidence was discharged, and he left the country. From that year to the one in which the oddly shaped turnip was plucked, the field had not been sown with turnips, and it was said that the man (a servant of Mr J. Biddulph's) who pulled it out of the ground, did so on the very spot where Gurney's murdered body hid been found, and to the astonishment and dismay of the neighbours it was found to resemble the hand of Powell even to a wart npon one of the fingers.

Spring Assizes

TALE OF A TURNIP.-A man has, the last day or two, been exhibiting in Monmouth, a singularly formed turnip, of the sort called the tankard turnip. It is exactly in the shape and appearance of a man's right hand, minus the thumb. So far this production of nature is singular and passing strange but a tale hangs thereby, which, if true in all its parts, would make a person, not over superstitious, exclaim—"  Wonderful!" "Murder, though it hath no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ." The story is. About six years since, the body of a man named Gurney, a toll-gate keeper, was found, barbarously murdered in a turnip field near Ledbury. The unfortunate man in his agonies had grasped his hands full of the green tops of the turnips. A waggoner, named Powel], an athletic man, and who had by accident lost his right thumb, was apprehended on suspicion of being concerned in the murder, but, for want of evidence to implicate him, he was discharged, and immediately left the country. On the 4th of December last, the first year that the field had been resown with turnips since the perpetration of the murder, a servant of J. Biddulph, Esq. was passing through, and wishing for a turnip to eat, plucked one from the very spot where the dead body of Gurney was found, six years since. What was his astonishment and dismay when he drew one which, it is affirmed, is a facsimile of the suspected murderer's hand, even to a wart which was growing upon one of the fingers! Since this occurrence, the neighbours have invested the field with lots of imaginary horrors—"strange sights are seen," and a fortune would scarcely bribe the stoutest hearted inhabitant of Ledbury to pass it at the witching hour of night."
