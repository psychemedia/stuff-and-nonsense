## Corpse Candle

In Bygones, [February, 1872, p. 36](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2092952/7#?xywh=-478%2C-702%2C5026%2C3315):

I never heard of 'Grwn' death token mentioned by *edromo*, but I remember, some years ago, a highly intelligent inhabitant of Criggion, Montgomeryshire, telling me that when he was a bot, upon one occasion, during a vey heavy snow, his mother called him to her as she went up the stars one night to bed, and pointed out to him a light proceeding slowly from a neighbouring farmhouse in the direction of the church. A servant coming up the stairs at the time was also witness to it. The light traversed a line where there was no road or gate into the churchyard, and in a moment or two all the windows of the church were lighted up, and then gradually the light went back by the course it had come, and vanished in the neighbouring farmhouse. They knew, I believe, that their neighbour the farmer was unwell, but the snow was so deep that it was not until the second day that they heard he had died at the very time they saw the light. The snow continued, and the roads became more and more blocked, so that on the day of the funeral it was found to be impossible to take the procession by the ordinary course; so a portion of the churchyard wall was taken down, and the bier was carried through the opening. That portion was the very spot at which my friend saw the light cross on the evening of the death. –Jarco.

## First Corpse In a Cemetery

In ["A LADY TOURIST—ANECDOTES"](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000446/18380228/034/0003), Inverness Courier, Wednesday 28 February 1838, extracted from *"Hill and Valley, or Hours in England and Walks. By Catharine Sinclair, &c.. Dedicated the Travellers Club."*

The Highlanders have a superstition, which I never could trace to its origin, that Satan gets possession of the first corpse laid in new cemetery ! The time when I heard of this was in 1830 at Blair; on which occasion the innkeeper happened to mention, that a new burying-ground had been prepared during some years without ever coming into use, on account of no neighbouring family liking to lake the precedence. 'We are just waiting,' added the worthy landlady, looking hard at *me*, 'to see if, by good chance, some stranger dies in the place, who could be laid there at once.' After that, I very nearly resolved to sleep without a pillow at Blair, in case of being Burked ; and it is remarkable that an English sportsman about that time *fairly* died there, when, alter his interment in the new cemetery, it was adopted into use."
