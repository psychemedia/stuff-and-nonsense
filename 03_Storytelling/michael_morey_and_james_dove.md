*Michael Morey's dead,  
For cutting off his grandson's head,  
He is hung on Arreton Down  
For rooks and ravens to peck down.*  
  
If you turn left out of Robin Hill, past the Hare and Hounds pub, you'll see Burnt House Lane on the right, running down the valley towards Newport.  
  
Back in the early-1700s, just on the hillside to the left of there, lived a woodcutter, Michael Morey, his son and daughter in law, her sister, and James Dove, his grandson.  
  
There is a Morey's building and timber merchants on the island to this day: you'll see their yards just coming into Sandown, from Brading, in Ryde, and in Newport. I don't know if they are related.  
  
James's mother, Michael's daughter, had died giving birth to him fourteen years before; his father had abandoned him and remarried elsewhere on the island.  
  
Early one morning in June, 1736, shortly after sunrise, six a.m. or so, Michael Morey and his teenage grandson left their cottage at Sullens, setting off "on Pretence of going to a Market-town about seven Miles from him, to buy Necessaries", as an old report has it. Between them, they carried some old leather panniers.  
  
Shortly after, Michael must have returned home alone, but then he too disappeared. A week later, Michael returned; "being asked after the Child, he could not give a satisfactory Answer. He
was taken up on Suspicion; and upon searching a Chest belonging to him, his bloody Shirt (which was later produced in Court) was found wrapt up in a clean Shirt". He was placed in the care of his son, presumably under some sort of house arrest, and a hue and cry raised to search for James.  
  
Towards the end of July, Michael absconded again. Three days later, he was found again, a small reward paid for his return. Two weeks after that, he was sent to the Big Island, to the mainland, and imprisoned in in Winchester jail on suspicion of murder.  
  
But there was still no sign of James.  
  
Walking through nearby autumnal woods that October, another Arreton parishioner noticed... what? That's odd. Could there be hidden valuables in that old leather bag that seems half buried over there? Whatever he saw horrified him, and he made haste to summon help.  
  
A jury of witnesses, including the Coroner and the Bailiff, made their way back to the woods. Two half buried satchels were revealed, and opened. An arm here, a leg there were found in one; a bill hook for chopping wood, and, was that a head?, in the other.  
  
The body was unrecognisable, but a description at least of the clothes that still wrapped the putrefying body parts was made.  
  
A gravedigger was summoned — I don't know if he'd ever seen worse — a coffin made and the body quickly interred in the nearby Arreton church graveyard.  
  
The widowed mother of a neighbouring farmer, who had perhaps at times fashioned clothes for her neighbour's motherless child, had the clothes described to her, but she couldn't be certain they were James'.  
  
And so it was that the next day, James' body was dug up a for a second time. From his Hat, Breeches, Stockings, and Shoes, he was duly identified. He was reburied for a second, or should that be, a third?, time.  
  
The fate of Michael, still in Winchester gaol, was now surely settled; but it was not until February of the next year, 1737, that the great and the good of Arreton Parish met in the vestry of the church there, and grimly determined to pay for Michael's trial on a count of murder.  
  
At the Winchester Assizes starting on Wednesday, March 2nd, Michael stood trial. He made no confession. "What cruel Circumstances might have attended the Execution of th[at] horrid Fact [of murder], [was] only known to God and the Murderer". Michael was sentenced not just to death, but also to hanging in chains thereafter.  
  
There were no football matches on Saturdays in those days, but there were public hangings. A good a spectacle as any you could expect.  
  
And so it was that Michael was executed on Saturday, 19 March, 1737, at Gallows Hill, Winchester.  
  
But the story doesn't end there. Only part of the sentence had been fulfilled.  
  
Michael's body was brought back to the island, where it was wrapped in chains, a tightly fitting metal cage, made to measure by a local blacksmith.  
  
His caged body was then hung from a tall wooden gibbet, most likely spiked with nails at the bottom to prevent it from being cut down, on top of an ancient burial mound that overlooks Arreton valley.  
  
The mound is there to this day: we know it as Michal Morey's mound: if you turn left out of the Hare and Hounds, then left again onto the Down's road, you'll see it there to the right, just a few hundred yards down the road. If you're coming along the Down's road from Ryde, it's on the left, a few hundred yards before the T-junction at the end.  
  
Michael's body was never found - murderers would never be buried in consecrated ground. There is a skull on display in the Hare and Hounds that some claim to be Michael's, but whilst it is from the mound that bears his name, it dates from much older times. A memory of the gibbet can also be found in the same pub: one of beams, claimed to be the hewn from the gibbet itself, is carved with the date "1737". Look up in the room at the back, and you'll see it.  
  
Local folk traveling the Down's road to this day still mention seeing a ghostly figure walking nearby the mound, but whether it's the ghost of Michael, or James, or the ancients from the burial mound itself, who can say?  
  
So the next time you visit Robin Hill, listen out for the sound of woodsmen working round about; for the sound of chains clanking against who knows what in the distance; for the call of the birds circling there still.  
  
And bring to mind the playground rhyme learned by so many of Arreton's primary school children over the years:  
  
*Michael Morey's dead,  
For cutting off his grandson's head,  
He is hung on Arreton Down  
For rooks and ravens to peck down.*
