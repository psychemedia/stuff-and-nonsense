*Michael Morey's dead,  
For cutting off his grandson's head,  
He is hung on Arreton Down  
For rooks and ravens to peck down.*  
  
If you turn left out of Robin Hill, past the Hare and Hounds pub, you'll see Burnt House Lane on the right, running down the valley towards Newport.  
  
Back in the early-1700s, just on the hillside to the left of there, lived a woodcutter, Michael Morey, his son and daughter in law, her sister, and James Dove, his grandson.  
  
There is a Morey's building and timber merchants on the island to this day: you'll see their yards just coming into Sandown, from Brading, in Ryde, and in Newport. I don't know if they are related.  
  
James's mother, and Michael's daughter, Mary, had died giving birth to him fourteen years before; his father, Thomas Dove, originally of Brading, had abandoned him and remarried elsewhere on the island.  
  
Early one morning in June, 1736, shortly after sunrise, six a.m. or so, Michael Morey and his teenage grandson left their cottage at Sullens, setting off "on Pretence of going to a Market-town about seven Miles from him, to buy Necessaries", as an old report has it. Between them, they carried some old leather panniers.  
  
Shortly after, Michael must have returned home alone, but then he too disappeared. A week later, Michael returned; "being asked after the Child, he could not give a satisfactory Answer. He was taken up on Suspicion; and upon searching a Chest belonging to him, his bloody Shirt (which was later produced in Court) was found wrapt up in a clean Shirt". He was placed in the care of his son, presumably under some sort of house arrest, and a hue and cry raised to search for James.  
  
Towards the end of July, Michael absconded again. Three days later, he was found again, a small reward paid for his return. Two weeks after that, he was sent to the Big Island, to the mainland, and imprisoned in in Winchester jail on suspicion of murder.  
  
But there was still no sign of James.  
  
Walking through nearby autumnal woods that October, another Arreton parishioner noticed... what? That's odd. Could there be hidden valuables in that old leather bag that seems half buried over there?  Whoo, hoo, this could be my lucky day... But whatever he saw horrified him, and he made haste to summon help.  
  
A jury of witnesses, including the Coroner and the Bailiff, made their way back to the woods. Two half buried satchels were revealed, and opened. An arm here, a leg there, a bill hook for chopping wood, and, was that a head? 
  
The body was unrecognisable, but a description at least of the clothes that still wrapped the putrefying body parts was made.  
  
A gravedigger was summoned — I don't know if he'd ever seen worse — a coffin made and the body quickly interred in the nearby Arreton church graveyard.  
  
The widowed mother of a neighbouring farmer, who had perhaps at times fashioned clothes for her neighbour's motherless child, had the clothes described to her, but she couldn't be certain they were James'.  
  
And so it was that the next day, James' body was dug up a for a second time. From his Hat, Breeches, Stockings, and Shoes, he was duly identified. He was reburied for a second, or should that be, a third?, time.  
  
The fate of Michael, still in Winchester gaol, was now surely settled; but it was not until February of the next year, 1737, that the great and the good of Arreton Parish met in the vestry of the church there, and grimly determined to pay for Michael's trial on a count of murder.  
  
At the Winchester Assizes starting on Wednesday, March 2nd, Michael stood trial. He made no confession. "What cruel Circumstances might have attended the Execution of th[at] horrid Fact [of murder], [was] only known to God and the Murderer". Michael was sentenced not just to death, but also to hanging in chains thereafter.  
  
There were no football matches on Saturdays in those days, but there were public hangings. A good a spectacle as any you could expect.  
  
And so it was that Michael was executed on Saturday, 19 March, 1737, at Gallows Hill, Winchester. Hung by the neck until he was dead.  
  
But the story doesn't end there. Only part of the sentence had been fulfilled.  
  
Michael's body was brought back to the island, where it was wrapped in chains, a tightly fitting metal cage, made to measure by a local blacksmith.  
  
His caged body was then hung from a tall wooden gibbet, most likely spiked with nails at the bottom to prevent it from being cut down, on top of an ancient burial mound that overlooks Arreton valley.  
  
The mound is there to this day: we know it as Michal Morey's mound: if you turn left out of the Hare and Hounds, then left again onto the Down's road, you'll see it there to the right, just a few hundred yards down the road. If you're coming along the Down's road from Ryde, it's on the left, a few hundred yards before the T-junction at the end.  
  
Michael's body was never found - murderers would never be buried in consecrated ground. There is a skull on display in the Hare and Hounds that some claim to be Michael's, but whilst it is from the mound that bears his name, it dates from much older times. A memory of the gibbet can also be found in the same pub: one of beams, claimed to be the hewn from the gibbet itself, is carved with the date "1737". Look up in the room at the back, and you'll see it.  
  
Local folk traveling the Down's road to this day still mention seeing a ghostly figure walking nearby the mound, but whether it's the ghost of Michael, or James, or the ancients from the burial mound itself, who can say?  
  
So the next time you visit Robin Hill, listen out for the sound of woodsmen working round about; for the sound of chains clanking against who knows what in the distance; for the call of the birds circling there still.  
  
And bring to mind the playground rhyme learned by so many of Arreton's primary school children over the years:  
  
*Michael Morey's dead,  
For cutting off his grandson's head,  
He is hung on Arreton Down  
For rooks and ravens to peck down.*

" Extract of a Letter from Hampshire.
At the Assizes at Winchester yesterday Se'enight,
an old Fellow of the Isle of Wight, was condemned for the Murder of his Grandson, about 14 Years of Age. He had bred him up from his Cradle ; and the Child having some way or other disobliged him, he took him out with him one Morning about Six o'Clock in June last , on Pretence of going to a
Market-town about seven Miles from him, to buy Necessaries, and carried him into a Wood, and murdered him with a Bill-hook, which he had taken with him for that Purpose. There was no Confession made by the Villain , nor was the Body found till October, when it could only be known by the Hat, Breeches, Stockings, and Shoes, which the Child had on when he went from Home, and which were found with the Body, together with the Bill-hook and the old Man's Gloves. He had cut off his Head , and mangled his Body, and put the whole into two Wallets, which he also carried with him. What cruel Circumstances might attend the Execution of this horrid Fact, is at present only known to God and the Murderer. The old Fellow did not return home till about a Week after the Fact was committed ; and being asked after the Child, and not giving a satisfactory Answer, he
was taken up on Suspicion ; and upon searching a Chest belonging to him, his bloody Shirt ( which was also produced in Court) was found wrapt up in a clean Shirt ; upon which he was committed at the Summer Assizes, and now tried , convicted, and condemn'd, and is to be hanged this Day at Winchester, but in Chains in the Isle of Wight."

He was accordingly executed on Saturday the 19th of March, but without making any particular Confession.

A LEGEND OF ARRETON DOWN

[A short time ago some men, digging on the down, found the skull with teeth perfect, amid other bones, supposed to be the remains of Micah Morey, a woodman, who was hunh there- for the murder of his grandson in the year 1735.] 

Old Micah Morey, I've heard say,  
His grandson's head cut off one day ;  
For some time after that, 'tis said  
He wandered in the fields, and fed  
On beans and peas, 'till he was caught,  
And for his crime to justice brought.  
He was the murderer proved to be,  
For which he paid the penalty.  
Upon a gibbet he was slung,  
Where many days the body hung,  
Which surely did the folks affright  
Who had to pass that way at night.  
At length some who more daring were  
Said it no longer should hang there,  
So cut it down, and hid from view  
The corpse, where none beside them knew.  
His ghost, howe'er. I've heard some say,  
Oit scared them when they pass'd that way.  
His bones which long were hid from sight,  
Have lately been exposed to light,  
From their long resting place exhumed,  
And rudely elsewhere are entombed.  
His skull a stranger brought away,  
Him to remind, at this late day,  
That Micah Morey for his crime  
Swung on the hill in olden time.  
In glass case 'tis exposed by him  
And prized as if a precious gem.  
The house in which the murderer dwelt  
He set on fire, and when rebuilt  
Twas "Burnt House" call'd – the name to-day,  
Though six score years have pass'd away.

Some years after, the bones having slipped from the gibbet, were collected and buried near the site. Las week some man digging there found the skull, with teeth perfect, and other bones.

ISLE OF WIGHT NOTES

BOYS' CAVE PERIL

A conesable had to cut steps in the cliff face with pick and shovel before two boys improsioned in "Michael Moreys Cave," on Arreton Down, could be released. The cave is one in which Michael Morey took refuge after murdering has grandson. Eventually he was caught and hanged, and buried at the spot. Five boys set out to explore and picnic in the cave, arriving about 11 am. Two managed to clamber into the cave, but heavy rain made the chalk so slippery that descent was impossible without assistance. They were marooned in the cave for over four hours, the other bous trying unsuccessfully to throw them food.
