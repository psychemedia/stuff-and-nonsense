# Twenty Years Hence
  
(The social distance of time...)

Mummy,  
  
Tell me again  
Why Grandpa sneezes into his elbow  
Instead of a tissue,  
  
And sings "Happy Birthday"  
Not once,  
But twice,  
*Every time* he washes his hands?  
  
Tell me again, Mummy,  
Tell me again: why?  
  
And when we go to the shop,  
To buy us our spice,  
Why does he put the sweets on the counter  
And then step back,  
  
And stay outside when you come too,  
  
And glare and stare  
When two grown ups  
Come into the shop  
Together?  
  
Why does he do that, Mummy,  
Why, oh why?  
Tell me again: just why?  
  
And if we go there  
For tea,  
On a Thursday,  
Why does he stand  
Outside of his house  
At eight o'clock,  
And stand there clapping,  
With tears in his eyes,  
For five whole minutes  
Just listening?  
  
Why, Mummy, oh why?  
Tell me again: just why?  
  
And why did Grandma have to die  
And leave him,  
When she was your age  
And you were mine?  
  
Why, Mummy, oh why?  
Tell me again: just why?  
  
You won't die too, Mummy,  
Will you?  
You please won't die?
