# Stuff and Nonsense

I don't have a quality filter,  
Make up stuff all of the time,  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Putting words into their lines.  
  
I don't have a quality filter,  
When writing nonsense verse,  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Could be better, 
Could be worse.  
  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Though I try and make stuff rhyme,  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Seems to work most of the time.  
  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Though I try to make it scan,  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Just do the best I can.  

As for an iambic pentameter,  
That doesn't even rhyme,  
"What's that, when it's at home?",  
I say.  
Without it, I'm just fine.  
  
So I don't have a quality filter,  
Whenever writing stuff,  
I don't have a quality filter,  
Which is why I churn so much.
