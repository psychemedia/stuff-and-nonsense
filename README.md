# Stuff'n'Nonsense

I went to a spoken word event,  
A week or two ago,  
I went to tell a story,  
To see how it would go.  
  
And as I was there  
It reminded me,  
How years  
Long long ago,  
I used to dabble with nonsense verse,  
  
And so,  
... and so...  
  
And so:  
Here's yet another repo,  
But for verse  
And not for code.  
  
Here's yet another repo,  
For silly nonsense words.
