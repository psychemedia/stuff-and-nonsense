# Ventnor Exchange Spoken Word Group

I've no idea,  
What "Spoken Word",  
Is quite supposed to be.  

And workshop games,  
And exercise,  
Are really just not me.

"Supportive" and "community",  
I'm too aloof for that,  
Classed alongside:  
"Self-help" groups,  
I'm not comf'tably sat.  

But had I not,  
Gone out that night,  
To the Ventnor Exchange,  
A prompt to write,  
A nonsense verse,  
Would not have been arranged.  

So maybe, maybe,  
Will I?  
Won't?  
Go back once again?  

Get prompted,  
In another way?  
From comfort zone to pain?  

Will I?  
Won't?  
Next time?  
Next?  
The next time after that?  

Will I?  
Won't I?  
Just go back,  
To have another crack?  

Who knows?  
Maybe?  
Maybe not?  

'Cos really,  
Truth be told,  
I'd rather tell a story,  
Or cover nonsense pome.
