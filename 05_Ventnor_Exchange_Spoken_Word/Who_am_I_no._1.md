# Who Am I?

I started out an Oxford don,  
Where logic was my game,  
Must needs: became a Reverend,  
Under my own name.

Made friends with the Dean's family,  
His daughters my delight,  
Told them stories, boating wise,  
Of hats and rabbits white.  

The name I'm better known by,  
Graced the covers of my books.  
The girls who framed the audience,  
Of photographs, I took.  

An epic nonsense poem of mine,  
I snarked in Sandown Bay.  
Acrostic'd to my best friend there,  
Young Gertrude Chataway.  

*Who am I?*
