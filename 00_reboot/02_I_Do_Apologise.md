# I Do Apologise

Or:  
*A complementary pair.*  
  
Or maybe:  
*Apposite, or opposite*?  

Anyway.  
  
I do apologise.  
  
I caught the germ of an idea,  
From a proper island poet.  
And I stole it.  
And I turned it,  
Into nonsense rhyming verse.  
  
*Fire ^fly, or water _fall*  
Was the key of the idea.  
*Fire ^fly, or water _fall*  
The phrase that I did hear.  
  
*[Fire ^fly, or water _fall]*  
  
Just what do you call that?  
An opposite?  
An "apposite"?  
A clever poet's trap?
  
^Early hours  
_Later that day,  

Woke ^up,  
from a _deep sleep,  
Looked around, now _wide awake,  

Scribbled madly,  
Blunted pencil:  
A single, direct take.
 
My mind was crazy racing.  
Early hours of the morn,  
Mind was in a frenzy,  
Words just tumbled until dawn.  
   
So I picked upon the word ^play,  
Could I make the numbers _work?  
From turns of phrase,  
To apposites,  
In mindless rhyming verse?  

I took th'idea and stole it,  
I do apologise,  
I hope I didn't break it,  
In other people's eyes.  

*[Fire ^fly, or water _fall]*  
  
That key essential phrase,  
An apposite?  
Or opposite?  
My mind was in a daze.  

*[Fire ^fly, or water _fall]*  
  
*[Fire ^fly, or water _fall]*  
  
"Stairs go ^up,  
But they also go _down",  
Was as far as I could get.  
  
"You can never be  
^On  
The _other side,  
Of the road"  
Was even worser yet.  
  
So that's where I had to leave it,  
That germ of an idea,  
An observation, nonsense versed,  
Of a phrase that I did hear.  
  
Some people might call it plagiarism,  
But I just call it theft.  
If you *can* steal,  
An idea phrase?  
Copyright,  
Not copyleft.  
  
I caught the germ  
Of an idea,  
And I turned it into this.  
Someone else's insight, really.  
Someone else's clever twist.  
    
*[Fire ^fly, or water _fall]*  
Just what do you call that?  
An opposite?  
An "apposite"?  
A clever poet's trap?
