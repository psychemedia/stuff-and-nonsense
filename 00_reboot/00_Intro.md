*Spoken word events seem to default to the presence of poets, not storytellers.
But at our local storytelling meet-up (Island Storytellers, third Monday of the month, 7pm+, location varies)
I often try to find my voice and calm my nerves for the evening by reciting (from memory) a piece of classic nonsense verse. 
So that seemed a sensible way to introduce myself at my first spoken word meetup, 
an afternoon session at the rather wonderful [Monkton Arts Caf√©](https://monktonarts.learningvialiving.co.uk/):
with some nonsense.
But that night it occurred to me that maybe I could introduce myself at such events with some nonsense of my own.
Something like this, maybe?*

# Intro
  
I'm a covers poet really,  
Telling other peoples' stuff,  
Telling other peoples' poems,  
They're already good enough,  
To have been published,  
  
In a book,  
  
Or told upon a stage,  
  
They've already been approved,  
Via proper typeset page.
  
I never have to worry,  
If the words are good enough,  
  
I know they are,  already:  
  
They're others peoples' stuff.  

So I'm a covers poet really,  
Taking poems out on loan,  
Giving them a voice again,  
And finding them new homes.
