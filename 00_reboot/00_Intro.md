*Spoken word events seem to default to the presence of poets, not storytellers.
But at our local storytelling meet-up (Island Storytellers, third Monday of the month, 7pm+, location varies)
I often try to find my voice and calm my nerves for the evening by reciting (from memory) a piece of classic nonsense verse. 
So that seemed a sensible way to introduce myself at my first spoken word meetup, 
an afternoon session at the rather wonderful [Monkton Arts Caf√©](https://monktonarts.learningvialiving.co.uk/):
with some nonsense.
But that night it occurred to me that maybe I could introduce myself at such events with some nonsense of my own.
Something like this, maybe?*

# Intro
  
I'm a covers poet really,  
Telling other peoples' stuff,  
Telling other peoples' poems,  
They're already good enough,  
To have been published,  
  
In a book,  
  
Or performed upon a stage,  
  
They've already been approved,  
Via proper typeset page.
  
I never have to worry,  
If the words are good enough,  
  
I know they are,  already:  
  
They're others peoples' stuff.  
  
They may not be originals,  
They may not be my own,  
Not written down as manuscript,  
Or typed into a phone,  
  
But committed unto memory,  
At least as best I can,  
I hope you'll find these words not mine,  
In keeping with your jam.  
  
So I'm a covers poet really,  
Taking poems out on loan,  
Giving them a voice again,  
And finding them new homes.


## And for a second visit...

You may know me as a covers poet  
For telling nonsense rhymes,  
Retrieved from classic literature  
From written far off times  

For telling made up stories,  
Reciting ballad tales,  
Committed unto memory,  
At least until it fails.  

Before the Marvel universe  
And DC Comic worlds,  
The fabled isles of nonsense  
And journeyed places told  

Of Jabberwocks and Jumblies  
Of Butchers feeling queer,  
Of Crumpety Hats and Pobbles' toes,  
Of Carroll, and of Lear  

So I'm a covers poet really,  
Turning up here once again,  
To spout some silly nonsense verse,  
From someone else's pen.
