# Nothing Big, Or Clever

There's nothing big,  
There's nothing clever,  
About writing nonsense verse,  
There's nothing big,  
There's nothing clever,  
It's just words that follow words.

There's nothing big,  
There's nothing clever,  
Writing words,  
That follow words,  
There's nothing big,  
There's nothing clever,  
Writing silly nonsense verse.  
  
There's nothing big,  
There's nothing clever,  
About writing nonsense verse,  
There's nothing big,  
There's nothing clever,  
It's just words that follow words.  
  
But they feel nice,  
And they taste nice,  
As you say the words aloud.  
  
And it tastes nice,  
And it feels nice,  
That silly nonsense verse.  
  
It's automatic writing,  
As surrealists used to play,  
The words  
And then the lines,  
You see    
Come out in their own way.  
  
The lines just seem to write themselves,  
The rhymes tease out the words,  
I don't ever do *poems* as such,  
Just silly nonsense verse.
